# yar

`yar` takes a hard line on program shape: errors are explicit, variants are
closed, and output is native. It is for people who want a language that makes
failure handling visible, keeps data modeling strict, and compiles all the way
down to executables through LLVM IR and `clang`.

## Why yar

- Errors are part of the function contract, not a side channel.
- Enums are closed and `match` is exhaustive, so branching stays honest.
- Packages are explicit, exported APIs are deliberate, and cross-package access
  stays visible in the source.
- The compiler produces LLVM IR and native executables. There is no interpreter
  and no VM boundary.
- The standard library is written in yar and compiled through the same pipeline
  as user code.

## Quick Example

```
package main

import "strings"

fn greet(name str) !void {
    if strings.contains(name, " ") {
        return error.InvalidName
    }
    print("hello, ")
    print(name)
    print("\n")
}

fn main() !i32 {
    greet("world")?
    return 0
}
```

```bash
./bin/yar run greet.yar
hello, world
```

## What it already does

Yar currently supports:

- Top-level `struct`, `enum`, and `fn` declarations
- `bool`, `i32`, `i64`, `str`, `void`, `noreturn`, `error`
- Typed pointers, fixed arrays, slices, and maps
- Multi-file packages rooted at an entry `package main`
- `if`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, and exhaustive `match`
- String indexing, slicing, concatenation, and equality
- Native builds, IR emission, and direct execution from the CLI

The embedded standard library currently includes:

- `strings` — string helpers and `parse_i64`
- `utf8` — decoding and rune classification
- `conv` — numeric and byte/string conversion helpers
- `sort` — in-place sorting for `[]str`, `[]i32`, and `[]i64`
- `path` — path normalization and joining
- `fs` — text file and directory operations
- `process` — argv access and child-process execution
- `env` — environment lookup
- `stdio` — stderr output

## What it does not try to do

Yar does not currently have:

- Methods
- Generics
- Closures
- Interfaces
- Garbage collection

The language and standard library are intentionally constrained. The compiler
is the source of truth for implemented behavior.

## Install

Requirements:

- Go 1.26+
- `clang`

Build the CLI:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/yar ./cmd/yar
```

Use `CC` to override the compiler command if needed:

```bash
CC=clang-17 ./bin/yar build main.yar
```

## Why this repo matters

Use yar when you want:

- A language and compiler you can actually read end to end
- A language with explicit failures instead of implicit exception flow
- Native executables without a VM boundary
- A current implementation that already covers packages, enums, maps,
  pointers, and host-backed stdlib calls

The implemented surface is intentionally explicit. See
[docs/YAR.md](docs/YAR.md) for the exact behavior the compiler supports today.
